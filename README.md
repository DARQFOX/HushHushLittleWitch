# HushHushLittleWitch

•	The number of players will be between 2 and 4. It won’t change for the entire game.
•	There are 5 colors (red, orange, yellow, blue, green) token.
•	There are 5 indistinguishable black witch hats.
•	There is one dice which has a color on each face and then a shuffle.
•	There are 5 rows. At the beginning, all the tokens are at the bottom row. Any token crossing the 5thsignals the end of the game (and a win).
•	Any player can move any token.

Starting point: each hat is placed on top of the tokens. The hat/token pairs are then shuffled and placed on the starting line without anyone knowing the colors/placement combinations.

For each player, a turn is composed of three steps:

1.	Rolling the die
2.	If the die falls on a color, then the current player guesses which of the hats has the witch of the correct color under it. If the guess is correct, the player does another round. Otherwise, this ends their turn
3.	If the die falls on shuffle, the player can exchange the positions of the 5 die/token combinations. This ends their turn.
